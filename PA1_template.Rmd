## Loading and preprocessing the data
# unzipping the archive that should be present in your working directory 
unzip("activity.zip")
# read the resulting file
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=T)

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
stepday <- tapply(activity$steps, list(activity$date), sum, na.rm=T)
hist(stepday)
meanstep <- mean(stepday)
meanstep #9354.23
medianstep <- median(stepday)
medianstep #10395

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
dailypat <- tapply(activity$steps, list(activity$interval), mean, na.rm=T)
dailypat
# making the plot
r plot, fig.width=4, fig.height=3, message=F}
plot(1:length(unique(activity$interval)), dailypat, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Mean number of steps", main="Daily activity pattern")

# finding which interval is the most active
mostactive <- which.max(dailypat)
names(mostactive) # 835

## Imputing missing values

# sorry, I ran out of time before the weekend and could not complete 
# all of the sections!

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
